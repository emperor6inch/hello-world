# hello-world
i've been studying since about 5 months. the more I study, the dumber I find myself to become in the world of software development. now I've found that the secret is to make projects the study route. this is my first program which says "Hello world'. 

My name is Oluyanju Oluwaseyi. I am here to be a part of the future. I wish I had stumbled upon software development 5 years back. but as they say, better late than never. I'm here to learn how builders build, how creators create. and how the 1% of the 1% do their things.
here"s to a wonderful, fulfilling and profitable fututre.
BOOM!
